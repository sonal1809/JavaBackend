-   synchronized instance methods lock on the object instance (this).
    Two threads calling synchronized methods on the same instance block each other.
    If they call on different instances, they do not block.

-   static synchronized methods lock on the Class object (ClassName.class) â€” this is class-level locking;
    all static synchronized methods of that class share that lock.

-   Use instance locks when you need per-object mutual exclusion;
    use class-level locks when you need a single lock across all instances.
