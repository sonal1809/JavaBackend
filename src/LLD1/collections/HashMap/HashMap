If we want to use a custom class (like Employee) as a key in a HashMap, you must override hashCode() and equals() properly.
* Key Points to Remember
    1. Always override both equals() and hashCode() together.
    2.Contract rules:
        a.If equals() says two objects are equal, their hashCode() must be the same.
        b.If hashCode() is same, objects may or may not be equal.

    3.Use Objects.hash() and Objects.equals() to avoid boilerplate code.
    4.Use only immutable fields (like id) for equality â€” otherwise keys can break if fields change after insertion.
